# Alexandre Magno
<sub> *Data Scientist* </sub>

I have been studying Data Science since January 2021. I am in the sixth period of Industrial Mathematics and I am doing a scientific initiation in Operational Research.



I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as  classifying diseases early and buying houses at a price below the market.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.


**Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression.

**Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku

## Data Science Projects:

### [Cardiovascular Disease Detection](https://github.com/Alexandre-Magno/CardioCatchDisease)
In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to detect disease in early stages with **74% accuracy** over 70k patience.
The performance of this model would increase **revenue of U$175.3 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [Sales Forecast](https://github.com/Alexandre-Magno/rossmann_sales)
In this project, I developed a machine learning model capable of **forecasting sales** and the resulta can be accessed by a bot on Telegram


## Data Analysis - Insight Projects

### [Real Estate Market](https://github.com/Alexandre-Magno/House_Rocket_Insights)
In this project I developed a business solution using exploratory data analysis.The solution would increase **revenue of U$678.1 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.
